Description
I was contracted as a Data scientist by an electric car-sharing service company to analyse electric car usage over time in Paris and identify the most popular time to pick up a shared electric blue car in Paris in April of 2018, among other things.  

The key outputs from my data analysis are as follows:
•	2100 hours was the most popular hour for picking up a blue car in Paris.
•	0400 hours was the most popular hour for picking up a blue car in Paris
•	Paris-voltaire-182 was the most popular station overall.
•	Paris-tronchet-19 of postal code is 75008 was the most popular station overall. 
•	75015 was the most popular postal code overall.
•	75014 was the most popular code at the most popular picking hour.
•	An analysis of the utilib and utilib 1.4 counters yielded no results given that we had dropped any existing outliers when we cleaned our data.
